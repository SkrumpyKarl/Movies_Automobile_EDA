# Automobile and Movies EDA

This project involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Automobile Dataset which is a collection of data on various automobiles, and a Movies dataset which is a collection of data on various movies.

- Autmobile: The dataset includes information such as make, model, fuel type, engine size, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and other specifications.
- Movies : The dataset includes information such as movie titles, release years, genres, ratings, and other information. The analysis is performed on various features of the dataset, including genres, popularity, runtime, and revenue.

The code is written in Python 3.11 and run on a Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code. 

## Required Libraries
The following packages are required to run the code:

- Numpy 
- Pandas
- Seaborn 
- Missingno 
- Scipy 
- Matplotlib

## EDA 

The EDA is performed using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to create visualizations of the various features of the dataset. The analysis helps to identify trends and patterns in the data and is useful for understanding the automobile and movie industry.

## Usage
To run the notebook, open the automovile.ipynb and movies.ipynb files in VSC and run it in a Python environment. The notebook will load the dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and perform various analyses and visualisations of the data.
